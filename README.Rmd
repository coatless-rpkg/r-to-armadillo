R is an amazing language to explore and communicate statistics with. However, when we care about attain results quickly, R's primary weakness is shown: speed. The objective of this repository is to strengthen this weakness by providing high performing R base functions within [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html) (and potentially eigen). Futhermore, as the code is written within C++, the code is able to be ported to different platforms at ease. Lastly, an additional benefit of this project is a repository containing programming examples by field.

Feel free to use the functions available within the repository per the MIT License.

# Project Details

The functions written here act either as a means to replicate existing R functionality within [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html) or as a helpful interface to [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html)'s objects to perform crazier operations. These functions are meant to be easily included within existing code bases with minimal dependencies. In its packaged form, the project uses the R to C++ interface afforded by [`RcppArmadillo`](https://github.com/rcppcore/rcpparmadillo)

**Note:** At some point in the future, these functions may end up being merged into the [`RcppArmadillo`](https://github.com/rcppcore/rcpparmadillo) project.

The current implementation has:

* [Distributions](https://github.com/coatless-rpkg/r-to-armadillo/blob/master/src/distributions.cpp)
    * Random Sampling
        * Wishart
        * Inverse Wishart
* [Time Series](https://github.com/coatless-rpkg/r-to-armadillo/blob/master/src/ts.cpp)
    * Difference by lag and number of differences
    * Discrete Integration by lag, number of differences, and - optionally - initial values.
    * Convert ARMA process to an infinite MA process
    * Compute the theoretical autocorrelation function (ACF) for an ARMA process.
    * Convolution (Moving Average) or Recursive (Autoregression) filters.
    * Calculate Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) for Autocovariance Function (ACF)
* [Sequences](https://github.com/coatless-rpkg/r-to-armadillo/blob/master/src/seq.cpp)
    * Generate Integer Sequence from `a` to `b`
    * Generate Double Sequence form `a` to `b` or `-a` to `a` with `n` points.
    * Obtain a sequence along a vector.
    * Obtain a sequence given a vector length.
* [Manipulations](https://github.com/coatless-rpkg/r-to-armadillo/blob/master/src/manipulations.cpp)
    * Vector
        * Reverse vector (e.g. `1:3` => `3:1`)
    * Matrix
        * Reverse subset for row/column (e.g. `0:3` vs. `3:0`)
        * Subset Non-connected Regions (e.g. `c(0,1)` and `c(2,1)`)
    * Field
        * Convert `field<vec>` to `mat`
        * Total sum of elements in `field`
